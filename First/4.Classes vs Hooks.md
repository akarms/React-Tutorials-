In the Src folder we have the index.js file which is the entry point of our application.

there you can see function App() which is a component.

This is a functional component.

A functional component coulb be in hooks or in classes.

## Hooks vs Classes

### Hooks

Hooks are functions that let you hook into React state and lifecycle features from function components.

this is specifically maded for react functional components.

example of hooks:

```JS


```


### Classes

Classes are the blueprint of an object.

getting Start with classes:

First you have to import React from react library

```JS
import { Component } from 'react';
```

Then you have to create a class and extend it from Component

```JS

class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>hello world</h1>
            </div>
        )
    }
}

```

In here in the render method we are returning a div with a h1 tag.
